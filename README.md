# 3D Game

## 🎮 Project Overview
This is a simple 3D game created to learn the basics of 3D development. Through this project, I gained experience in 3D modeling, physics simulation, and implementing fundamental game mechanics.

## 🚀 Features
- Free movement and camera control in a 3D environment
- Basic physics engine implementation
- Player interaction elements
- Simple UI with a scoring system

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 3d-game-project
   ```
3. Build the project using Makefile:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Python (for OBJ file format conversion)
- OpenGL (for rendering)
- 3D Modeling Tools (e.g., Blender)

## 🚧 Future Improvements
- Performance optimization
- Adding new levels and challenges
- Multiplayer support
